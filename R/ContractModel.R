# ContractModel.R  ContractModel refClass  set()  generic
##############################################################
#' A Reference Class that represents all Contract Models objects
#'
#' This class is only used in a virtual sense in that it is
#' not intended to create instances of it. It's use is to
#' provide the class structure, i.e. field definitions, to
#' various implementations of Contract Models for specific
#' Contract Types and as a means for designing method-inheritage.

# some additional notes about references to Java in the original file
