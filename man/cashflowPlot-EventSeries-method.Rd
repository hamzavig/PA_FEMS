\item{evs}{a \code{\link{EventSeries}} object with contract events to be 
plotted}
}
\value{

\description{
Creates and displays a graphical representation of the cashflow events in 
  an  \code{\link{EventSeries}} object. An \code{\link{EventSeries}} captures
  the cashflows of a single ACTUS contract. The exported function
  cashflowPlot(\code{\link{EventSeries}}) displays the cashflow events of the
  contract graphically.
}
\details{
The graphical representation shows the different types of cashflow event
  such as Principal Payment, Interest Payment, etc. Cashflows are shown 
  as directional arrows. Incoming cashflows appear as arrows towards the 
  x-axis; outgoing cashflows appear as arrows away from the x-axis. 
  A color code indicates the type of the cashflow as described in detail in 
  the displayed legend of the plot.
