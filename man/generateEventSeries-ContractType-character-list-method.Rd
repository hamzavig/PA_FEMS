\description{
exported function to simulate a contract cashflows and create an
  EventSeries using  "ContractType", "list", "character" method instance.
  constructs an EventSeries instance including as its events_df attribute a
  dataframe of cashflow events for the input ACTUS contract. This cashflow
  is generated with a callout to the ACTUS server located at ACTUS-server-URL
  using a risk scenario specified as the list of risk factors. THe method
  works by first creating a Portfolio with this ine contract and the supplied
  risk factor list, then calling generateEvents on this portfolio
}
\details{
This is an internal method on EventSeries, and not exported.
  generateEventSeries <contract>, risk-factors>, <serverURL> is the
  exported wrapper function which is exported from FEMSdevPkg and calls this.
