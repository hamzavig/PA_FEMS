\title{Derive the sensitivity of a contract's value with respect
to a change in risk factors}
\usage{
sensitivity(object, yield, ...)

\S4method{sensitivity}{Node,YieldCurve}(object, yield)

showSensitivity(node, ...)

\S4method{showSensitivity}{Node}(node)

\arguments{
\item{object}{object \code{Node}}

}
\value{
A \code{numeric} object giving the sensitivity
}
\description{
Different sensitivity-concepts can be derived from a financial
instrument or its analytical value, respectively. Currentently, 
these are only the Fisher-Weil for Maturity-contracts.
}
\details{
Fisher-Weil Duration is a measure for the sensitivity of the net present
value of a Maturity instrument to a parallel Shift in the related
yield curve. This measure is based on the discounted cash flows of the 
instrument.
